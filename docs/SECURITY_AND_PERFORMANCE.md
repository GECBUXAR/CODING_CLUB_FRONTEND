# Security and Performance Improvements

This document outlines the security and performance improvements implemented in the Coding Club application.

## 1. Security Enhancements

### 1.1 Authentication Improvements

#### Token Management
- Implemented a centralized token manager (`tokenManager.js`) for consistent token handling
- Added token rotation for refresh tokens to prevent token reuse
- Enhanced JWT security with additional claims and validation
- Improved token invalidation for logout

#### Rate Limiting
- Implemented enhanced rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Added security headers to rate-limited routes
- Configured different limits for different types of endpoints:
  - Authentication: 10 requests per 15 minutes
  - User creation: 5 requests per hour
  - API: 100 requests per 15 minutes
  - Password reset: 3 requests per hour

### 1.2 CORS Configuration

- Simplified and secured CORS configuration
- Implemented proper error handling for CORS issues
- Added security headers to all responses
- Removed the CORS bridge HTML file in favor of proper CORS handling
- Enhanced CORS error diagnostics in the frontend

### 1.3 Security Headers

Added the following security headers to all responses:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` (in production)
- `Cache-Control` headers for sensitive routes

### 1.4 Error Handling

- Improved error handling with sanitized error messages
- Added request body sanitization for logging
- Enhanced CORS error messages with helpful diagnostics
- Implemented consistent error format across the application

## 2. Performance Improvements

### 2.1 Code Splitting

- Implemented React.lazy() and Suspense for route-based code splitting
- Added a loading fallback component for better user experience
- Lazy loaded all major components:
  - Public pages (Landing, About, Contact)
  - Auth pages (Login, Signup)
  - User pages (Dashboard, Profile, Exams)
  - Admin pages (Dashboard, Exam Panel)

### 2.2 State Management Optimization

- Created an optimized context provider pattern (`optimized-context.jsx`)
- Implemented context splitting to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Added memoization for expensive computations
- Created selector pattern for optimized state access
- Implemented the optimized pattern for auth context

### 2.3 API Connection Diagnostics

- Enhanced API connection warning component
- Added diagnostic information for connection issues
- Implemented connection testing functionality
- Improved error messages for different types of connection issues

## How to Use the Optimized Context Pattern

The new optimized context pattern provides better performance by:
1. Splitting state and dispatch into separate contexts
2. Memoizing action creators
3. Using useMemo for derived state

Example usage:

```jsx
// Create a context
const { Provider, useStateContext, useActions } = createOptimizedContext({
  initialState,
  reducer,
  actions,
});

// Use the context in components
function MyComponent() {
  const state = useStateContext();
  const { someAction } = useActions();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{state.someValue}</p>
      <button onClick={() => someAction()}>Do Something</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Future Improvements

- Implement virtualized lists for large data sets
- Add React.memo() for pure components
- Implement proper input sanitization
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
